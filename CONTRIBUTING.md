# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. There is a lot to be done.

### Planning and issues

The project is still being planned. Open issues for anything that needs discussion or you think should be in the code.

### Issues and testing

TBD

### Documentation

TBD

### Pull requests

- The codebase is new so is in a state of flux.
- The code is in [Hy](https://docs.hylang.org). Python contributions will be considered if they are orthogonal to the rest of the code.
- If you are more used to python, you can use `hy2py` to see what the existing code looks like.
- Please try to keep consistent with the style - more like clojure and less like java.
- Short and simple functions are preferred. The code should fit inside your head.
- Avoid heavy dependencies.
- Try to use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
